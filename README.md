# BasicStocktakingManager
Basic stocktaking manager is built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Angular. Basic Stocktaking manager is a web application (SPA) that is meant to be a stocktaking software where the user has the option to create, read, edit and delete information about products in a table. The goal is to achieve storing data in a DB, have the option to read historic data, see statistics about the stock and have an user auth system.

My purpose for this app is to be a tool to learn more about Angular development.
